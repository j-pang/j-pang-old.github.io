title: "Dr. John Defended Today, Launches Site"
date: 2019-05-09

After five long years in Caltech, I'm happy to announce that I have successfully defended my thesis today on "Online Platforms for Networked Markets". As I am leaving Caltech soon, I am also starting this new site, where I will aim to commit to blog about either a published work or on an interesting experience that I had. I aim to do this twice each month, on the first and third Sunday of the month, starting June 2019. My first blog post will aim to be a "Bystander's view of my thesis", which hopefully will be at a general enough level. 

In the next few days, I aim to migrate my information from my old site over here, and hope to also provide links to my publications and currciulum vitae here.
