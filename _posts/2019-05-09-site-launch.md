title: "Dr. John Pang, Defended Today, Launches New Site"
date: 2019-05-09

After five long years in Caltech, I'm happy to announce that I have successfully defended my thesis today on "Online Platforms for Networked Markets". As I am leaving Caltech soon, I am also starting this new site, where I will aim to commit to blog about either a published work or on an interesting experience that I had. I aim to do this twice each month, on the first and third Sunday of the month, starting June 2019.
