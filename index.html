								<h2 class="major">Work</h2>
								<p>I am excited to be joining Schlumberger's Software, Technology and Innovation Center (STIC) in Menlo Park as a Data Scientist starting July 2019. </p>

								<p>During my time at Caltech, I was fortunate to also spend two summers at STIC, where I help automate processes in Schlumberger, using a combination of machine learning, reinforcement learning, signal processing and optimization. </p>

								<p>Prior to my Ph.D at Caltech, I worked as a research engineer at the Institute of High Performance Computing, one of Singapore's national research institutes. During the nine-month stint, I was involved with two projects, which led to multiple publications. </p>

								<h2>Retaliating against colluding drivers in Uber</h2>
								<p> <b> Information and power are limited for each single driver on ridesharing applications like Uber. However, when pushed against the wall, drivers work together and collude, allowing them sufficient power and information to help them beat these ridesharing companies at their game. </b></p>
								<p>Many startups today, including ridesharing companies like Uber and Lyft, revolve around a central planner or intermediary, known also as an online platform. These platforms, do not usually themselves produce nor consume, and only serve to bring multiple parties together, such as drivers and riders on Uber. There are many ways to design these platforms, varying over a range of control and transparency. </p>
								<span class="image main">
									::before
									<img src="images/gifmaker.gif" alt>
								</span>
								<p>These participants do not always react to the designs the way the central planner hopes, and they may at times collude and resist the control of the platform. For example, Uber and Lyft drivers that were unhappy with the amount of pay they received recently logged off from their applications in a coordinated fashion to create an artificial demand-supply shortfall, manipulating surge pricing. The same idea of artificial shortfall of supply by Enron also caused the California Energy Crisis in 2000, costing $40B in losses. This means that platform designs need to ensure participants’ selfish actions do not harm the overall system drastically, and is an active topic of research in the Wierman lab.</p>
								<p>Different platform designs lead to different outcomes and can be vulnerable to varying levels of manipulation, depending on factors including the number of participants on each side of the market and non-monetary costs such as consumer search costs.</p>
								<p>The main challenge in understanding platform designs is to incorporate potentially individualistic and selfish actions of participants, and the possibility of collusion amongst participants. Platforms such as Uber may assume that due to their scale, participants have limited information and power for manipulating prices. A disregard of the potential for collusion allowed Uber drivers to coordinate, especially near hotspots such as airports. The coordination allows them to artificially create supply-demand shortfalls and force the platform to trigger surge pricing. </p>
								<p>Graduate student John Pang, together with collaborators at Cornell University, and his advisor Adam Wierman, study platform design under a networked economic model. In a recent publication, they showed that platforms that control allocations, when misaligned with producer incentives, can instead disincentivize production (or hours spent driving for Uber drivers). Such designs shift competition between producers to a setting where producers are incentivized to cooperate and together compete against the platform. In the same work, Pang and his co-authors showed that designs allowing access for every firm to every consumer increase competition between them and result in an “almost efficient” market, i.e., one that preserves at least a good proportion of the social welfare under a benevolent dictatorship.</p>
								<p>“The network competition model we study had surprising results to what you would see in these platforms, such as the collusion and cooperating between firms,” says Pang. “The question now, is, can we find a solution using these models to reduce the impact and incentives of collaboration and collusion in these platforms?” </p>
								<p>“We are now working on generalizing the work to also look at electricity markets, where such collusions manifest with much more devastating effects, such as in the California Energy Crisis in 2000,” John explains while introducing a new collaborator in this extension in Subhonmesh Bose, a previous student from the lab who is now an assistant professor at University of Illinois. They found that consumers can help prevent manipulation in these platforms by being flexible in their demand. </p>
								<p>The first paper titled “Transparency and Control in Platforms for Networked Markets” is under submission to Operations Research, while the second paper titled “Anticipation and Demand Management in Platforms for Networked Markets” is under submission to Management Science. Both papers are currently available on ArXiV.
